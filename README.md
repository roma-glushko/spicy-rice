# Spicy Rice!

üçö Spice Rice is an open source named entity annotator for your tiny/hobby NLP projects.

Spicy Rice is designed to be:

- zero-configuration
- cross-platform
- easy to setup and use
- no backend/no database/no docker
- browser-based

Spicy Rice should be a quick and free alternative for nooby/hobby projects where it's not yet reasonable to buy and use professional tools like Prodigy.
There are other open source NER annotators, but Spicy Rice is different, it's going to be extreamly easy to get started. 

Everything that is needed from you:

- modern browser
- ability to run regular React/Redux project

## State

Project is in progress right now. No workable versions are available currently.
Please star this project and check it out later üôå

### ydeshayes/react-highlight

Huge shoutout to Deshayes Yann and ydeshayes/react-highlight library which is going to be used as a base for the entity annotator functionality.
We have to include the source of the library to this project to be able to run correctly.
Probably, we will be adjusting those sources according to project needs, but rights for the sources does belong to Deshayes Yann.
